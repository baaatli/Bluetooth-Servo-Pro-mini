# Bluetooth-Servo-Pro-mini
Using the HC-05 module with Arduino Pro Mini to control the angle of a micro servo motor. The HC-05 module brings data from smartphone to Arduino with the use of Bluetooth Classic and serializes it to send to Arduino using UART on software-defined serial pins. 

Using the Software Serial library for the same and standard Servo library for controlling SG90 Micro servo motor. The degree of rotation is sent through a smartphone which is set on the servo.
